<h2 data-start="811" data-end="830">About Best SARMs</h2>
<p data-start="832" data-end="1134"><strong data-start="832" data-end="846">Best SARMs</strong> refers to the most popular and widely discussed <strong data-start="895" data-end="937">Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators</strong> available in the fitness and research community. SARMs were originally developed for medical research to treat conditions such as muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and age-related loss of muscle mass.</p>
<p data-start="1136" data-end="1322">Over time, SARMs became popular among fitness enthusiasts because of their <strong data-start="1211" data-end="1231">selective action</strong>, which targets muscle and bone tissues more precisely than traditional anabolic compounds.</p>
<p data-start="1324" data-end="1372">Unlike anabolic steroids, SARMs are designed to:</p>
<ul data-start="1373" data-end="1474">
